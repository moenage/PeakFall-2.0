# PeakFall-2.0

This game was created for the Mountain Top Game Jam 2023 held at SFU! The theme was "Peak". We utilized Unity, C#, and Github for our team of 4. 
The game was inspired by the roguelite Downwell. We essentially have the player falling from the "Peak" avoid obstacles and gaining momentum to score higher points as they land on the enemy at the end.
We also had a funny story aspect to it where the player is actually a student doing a game jam and it has led them to jump from the "Peak" of SFU which is on a mountain.
